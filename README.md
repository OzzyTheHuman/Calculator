# Calculator
A console-based calculator project written in C#.<br />This application is developed using .NET 8. Right now only for windows.


## Instalation
You do not need .NET runtime.<br />Simply unzip newest version from **Releases**, locate **Calculator.exe** file and you are good to go.<br /> Sometimes windows defender will flag this as a virus, **its a false positive** and you are safe to ignore it.<br /> Check my source code, worst thing you will find is messy and inefficient code.
