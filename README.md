# Calculator
A console-based calculator project written in C#.<br />This application is developed using .NET 8. It is intended for Windows only.

## Installation
You do not need the .NET runtime installed.<br />
Simply unzip the **latest** version from **Releases** and run the **Calculator.exe** file. You're good to go!<br />
Sometimes Windows Defender may flag this app as a virus. **This is a false positive** and you can safely ignore the warning.<br />
Feel free to check my source code; the worst thing you might find is some messy or  inefficient code.

## TODO LIST

    - [x] Polish&nbsp;&nbsp; ***v1.0***
    - ~~ English ~~&nbsp;&nbsp; ***scrapped***
-  ~~ Mouse support ~~&nbsp;&nbsp; ***scrapped***

## Why Some Features Were Scrapped
With the knowledge I have today, I see that I should rewrite a big portion of my code. However, I have decided against this, wanting to keep this code as a history of how my skills in programming and problem-solving have evolved. <br />
Implementing mouse support is harder than I thought it would be and it's not really worth it (console-based apps rarely implement this feature). This app functions as I originally intended. <br />

It's time to move on to other projects. Thanks for reading !
